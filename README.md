**Command Line Arg**
* Starting from a blank JavaScript file, create a Node application that takes in two command line arguments and checks if they are equal. If the two numbers are equal then output: "true". Otherwise output: "false".

**Best Things Ever**
* Create a Node application that reads the best_things_ever.txt file, parses the comma separated elements, and ultimately console logs each element in the file on separate lines.

**BankJs**
* Starting from scratch, build a Node application called bank.js which takes in user inputs via the command line to register bank transactions.
* The transactions possible are:
  * total - this should tally up all of the money in the bank balance and display it for the user.

  *
 deposit <number> - this should add a positive amount to the bank balance. (No need to display the total here)


  * withdraw <number> - this should add a negative amount to the bank balance. (No need to display the total here)

  * 
lotto - this should subtract an amount from the bank balance, but if a random number is hit it should add back a larger amount into the bank balance.
* For all deposits, withdrawals, or lotto purchases the transaction should be registered in the bank.txt file.

**OMDB Axios Interactive**
* Using the code sent to you earlier as a reference and using the code provided to you as a starter, create a Node application which takes in a movie name as a command line argument then uses the OMDB API to retrieve and return the release date to the console.
